	Time complexity and efficient is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size. It is an essential factor in determining the performance and scalability of a program, as inefficient algorithms can lead to slow execution times and unresponsive applications.
</p>
	<p>
	Space Complexity and O(n) is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space. In recursive calls stack space also counts.
	</p>
<p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity. However, people frequently confuse Space-complexity with auxiliary space.
